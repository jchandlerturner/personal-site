                        <p>Often, people forget which wines they‚Äôve tried and what they thought of it, which can make it difficult when purchasing wine. Along with this, restaurant workers tend to not have a convenient place aside from pieces of paper, that they can keep their wine notes to stay up to date on ever-changing wine lists.

                        <h3 className="headingx">Testing</h3>
                        <p>I refined the UX & UI through testing with multiple classmates and coworkers in the restaurant industry. Based on feedback I got from multiple users, I decided to change the value of "location" on the cards to simplify the UX since most bartenders or servers wouldn't necessarily care about the location the wine was purchased at. 
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>I was also intent on building a social function for the app, but in user testing most people saw this app as most helpful as just a simple wine journal instead of a social platform.

                        <h3 className="headingx">Key Takeaways and Learnings</h3>
                        <p>This project was my first app I'd ever coded and taken all the way from ideation to development. Overcoming imposter syndrome was a huge part of this project, and I'm proud to have come out on the other side!
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Originally, I had a different idea of what this app would be‚ÄîI imagined it would be more of a social platform to share wine with friends, but as I started talking to coworkers I noticed that there was a specific problem I could tackle. After user testing, a few features I thought were "key" (plot twist: they were not) became obsolete and this app became simpler and more effective!
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        During talks with UX professionals, I got solid feedback on the UI of winedown such as; making the cards wider to give more margin and breathing room and also to consult Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) about tappable buttons and areas.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        In Version 2.0, I'd like to:
