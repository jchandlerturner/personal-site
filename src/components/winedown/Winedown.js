                        <p>Often, people forget which wines they‚Äôve tried and what they thought of it, which can make it difficult when purchasing wine. Along with this, restaurant workers tend to not have a convenient place aside from pieces of paper, that they can keep their wine notes to stay up to date on ever-changing wine lists.
